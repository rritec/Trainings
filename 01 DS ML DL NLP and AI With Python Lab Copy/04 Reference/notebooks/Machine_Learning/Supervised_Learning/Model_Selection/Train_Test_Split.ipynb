There are many ways to do this but for the purposes of Linear Regression we are going to do something called one-hot encoding.

Specifically, a column will be created for each day of the week in this example. So one column will parse into seven. \n",

They can only take values of 0 or 1, indicating if a fire occurred on that given day. The features are mutually exclusive meaning there can only be a 1 in one of the columns. All the rest have to be 0 because it's impossible for the same day to be both Monday and Thursday, for example. \n",

That's already encoded implicity when Sunday=0, Monday=0, Tuesday=0, Wednesday=0, Thursday=0, and Friday=0. If you're up on your linear algebra you realize that adding Saturday causes linear dependence, which is a no-no for Linear Regression which assumes independent features. Therefore, we **must** drop one column of each one-hot encoded feature. In this case we need to drop one column from month and one from day of week. Then we'll be in good shape."

The RMSE for the data the model saw (ISE) is significantly lower (by a factor of 3) than the RMSE for the data the model has never seen (OSE). In machine learning speak our model is *overfitting* meaning it's doing a much better job on the data it has seen but does not generalize well.

This is a small dataset so the skewed distribution in the target variable is having major consequences. A much larger dataset would still be affected but to a much smaller degree. With that in mind, you'll almost always see OSE's that are higher than ISE's. If not, there's something funky going on in your data like we have here. It's a good red flag to keep in mind when doing EDA. Anyway, we get very different results depending on how we split the data. In this case, I didn't change the proportion of data that's selected, merely how it's split. So how you split can dramatically affect your model. In some cases it generalizes well and other times it doesn't. \n",
